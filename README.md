### Data Stream

The data stream will send data to you as it's generated by our platform.

```
Important: The Stream might disconnect sometimes, as such, it is the client's responsibility to reconnect, as it might miss results while disconnected.
```

There are 2 types of data streams available that can be consumed:

##### 1. firehose

_Endpoint_: https://stream.api.binaryedge.io/v1/firehose

_Description_: This stream contains all data generated by Binaryedge own scans, these include WorldWide Scans. This stream is restricted, based on your client account. This stream does not contain data generated from jobs requested by clients.

##### 2. stream

_Endpoint_: https://stream.api.binaryedge.io/v1/stream

_Description_: This stream contains all data generated by your requested Jobs.

### Supported Types

There are 2 types of requests.

##### 1. scan
The scan type will request a scan on the targets and will launch the modules against the detected open ports. It should be used against a large number of targets and its function is to filter responding IPs.

##### 2. grab
The grab type will try to gather information directly from the targets.
Should be used against a small number of targets.


### Supported Modules

##### 1. ssh

_Description_: Extract SSH details, e.g. key and algorithms for SSH servers

_Detailed documentation_: [ssh module documentation](https://github.com/binaryedge/api-publicdoc/blob/master/modules/ssh.md "ssh")

##### 2. ssl
_Description_: Extract SSL details e.g. type of encryption

_Detailed documentation_: [ssl module documentation](https://github.com/binaryedge/api-publicdoc/blob/master/modules/ssl.md "ssl")

##### 3. vnc
_Description_: Extract VNC details and screenshot

_Detailed documentation_: [vnc module documentation](https://github.com/binaryedge/api-publicdoc/blob/master/modules/vnc.md "vnc")

##### 4. service
_Description_: Extract detailed product specific information, e.g. product name, version, headers, scripts. If you just want product name and version, consider using the faster "service-simple".

_Detailed documentation_: [service module documentation](https://github.com/binaryedge/api-publicdoc/blob/master/modules/service.md "service")

##### 5. service-simple (beta)
_Description_: Extract basic product specific information, e.g. product name, version. This module is much faster than "service", since it returns less information.

_Detailed documentation_: [service-simple module documentation](https://github.com/binaryedge/api-publicdoc/blob/master/modules/service-simple.md "service-simple")

##### 6. HTTP
_Description_: Extract HTTP information, e.g. HTTP headers, HTTP status codes, HTTP body, and redirects information. Follows up to 5 redirects.

_Detailed documentation_: [service-simple module documentation](https://github.com/binaryedge/api-publicdoc/blob/master/modules/http.md "http")

##### 7. Custom Modules
Note: If you want a custom-made module, please contact BinaryEdge.


### GET /v1/replay/job_id - Job Replay

To retrieve the results from a previously requested job, you can replay the stream with this endpoint.

```
curl https://stream.api.binaryedge.io/v1/replay/JOB_ID -H "X-Token:InsertYourClientToken"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
<Stream results from request job>
```

### POST /v1/tasks/job_id/revoke - Job Revoke

To cancel a requested job:

```
curl -XPOST https://api.binaryedge.io/v1/tasks/JOB_ID/revoke -H  "X-Token:InsertYourClientToken"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{"message": "Job revoked"}
```

### Job Status (Beta)

In order for you to know the status of your jobs we provide information in 2 distinct ways:


#### 1. GET /v1/tasks/job_id/status - Status Endpoint

To check the current status of a Requested job:

```
curl https://api.binaryedge.io/v1/tasks/<job_id>/status -H "X-Token:InsertYourClientToken"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{"message":"<STATUS>"}
```

Where Status can be:

  * "Requested": Job was requested successfully;
  * "Revoked": Job was revoked by user;
  * "Success": Job completed successfully;
  * "Failed": Job completed, but did not finish.


#### 2. Status Messages

In your stream you will find messages providing insight on the current status of your jobs:

***When a Job is created:***
```
{
	"origin": {
		"job_id": "c4773cb-aa1e-4356eac1ad08",
		"type": "job_status",
    ...
	},
	"status": {
		"success": null,
		"started": null,
		"completed": null,
		"revoked": null
	}
}
```

***Job is completed***
```
{
	"origin": {
		"job_id": "c4773cb-aa1e-4356eac1ad08",
		"type": "job_status",
    ...
	},
	"status": {
		"success": true,
		"started": true,
		"completed": true,
		"revoked": false
	}
}
```

Meaning of the status fields:

  * "success": If the job was completed successfully, with no problems.
  * "started": When a job is requested, it's put in to a Queue;
  * "completed": If the job is completed, no more results will be sent;
  * "revoked": If the job was canceled by the user or not.

### FAQ

**Q: What is the sample parameter?**

**A:** The Sample parameter is used to define how many open ports the platform needs to find before stopping the scan. It is useful to test modules and different configurations for each module (that we are adding in the future). This parameter is optional - by default the scan stops only after scanning the entire list of IP addresses and ports.


**Q: How can I consume the stream?**

**A:** The stream outputs to STDOUT, allowing you to consume it in different ways. For example:

- Direct the stream to a file:
    - `curl https://stream.api.binaryedge.io/v1/stream -H "X-Token:InsertYourClientToken" > file.txt`
- Pipe the stream to a custom application you developed to process it:
    - `curl https://stream.api.binaryedge.io/v1/stream -H "X-Token:InsertYourClientToken" | application_name `


**Q: What should I do if I get a error 500?**

**A:** In this case, you should contact support@binaryedge.io



**Q:** How do I scan multiple hosts with one request?

**A:**

```
options: [{
   "targets": [array of cidrs (string)],
   "ports": [{
       "port": int,
       "modules": [array of module names (string)],
       "sample": int
   }]
}]
```

for example:

```
{
   "type": "scan",
   "description": "test a bunch of networks",
   "options": [
       {
         "targets": ["xxx.xxx.x.x/xx","xxx.xxx.x.x/xx"],
         "ports": [{
            "port": 995,
            "module": "service"
           },
           {
            "port": 22,
            "module": "ssh"
           }]
       }, {
         "targets": ["xxx.xxx.x.x/xx"],
         "ports": [{
            "port": 5900,
            "module": "vnc"
         }]
       }
     ]
 }
 ```
